thus far, we have read the netflix_data data, filtered the duration, genre,
release year, title columns. We went on to perform the explanatory data analysis.
the EDA,the tables extracted and the emanating scatter plots show that indeed, the duration of movies have reduced

To be very certain, we may want run correlation or time series analysis on the data to tell
us how significantly movie duration have reduced over the years.
